Welcome to my new blog! This is my very first post, generated from a simple Markdown file.

## Why I Chose This Stack

I decided to use Next.js for a few key reasons:

1.  **Performance:** Static Site Generation (SSG) makes the site incredibly fast.
2.  **Developer Experience:** Writing in Markdown and having it automatically turn into a beautiful blog post is amazing.
3.  **SEO:** Next.js has fantastic built-in features for search engine optimization.

### Code Example

Here is a small snippet of TypeScript code:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "John Doe",
  id: 1,
};

console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}!`);
```
